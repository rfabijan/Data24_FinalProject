cleaning academy course:
	- Date cleaner now created
	- Output now contains:
		- start date of course
		- duration of course (Not cleaned)
		- name of course (Not cleaned)
	- New dataframe output



This is now also the problems in the pre-load formatter:
	- drop duplicates has stopped working :(
		1) drop duplicates isn't working over multiple columns :(
		2) IT LIIIIIIVES 

	- Nothing to join on as of yet when working with csv_academy_df
		1) Made the key in the other df to join on to, still no dice
		2) Data_list appears to populate properly, maybe the duplicate removing is causing problems?
		3) Turns out no, removing dupes does nothing
		4) Outer joining works, but also gives the exact wrong thing
