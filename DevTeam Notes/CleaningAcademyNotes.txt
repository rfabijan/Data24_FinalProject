cleaning academy course:
	- Date cleaner now created
	- Output now contains:
		- start date of course
		- duration of course (Not cleaned)
		- name of course (Not cleaned)
	- New dataframe output



This is now also the problems in the pre-load formatter:
	- drop duplicates has stopped working :(
		1) drop duplicates isn't working over multiple columns :(
		2) IT LIIIIIIVES 

	- Nothing to join on as of yet when working with csv_academy_df
		1) Made the key in the other df to join on to, still no dice
